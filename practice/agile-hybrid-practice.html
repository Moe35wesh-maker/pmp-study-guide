The Agile Manifesto values people and communication most highly."},{question:"Which Agile Manifesto value emphasizes working software?",options:["Value 1","Value 2","Value 3","Value 4"],correct:1,explanation:"The second value states 'Working software over comprehensive documentation.' This emphasizes delivering functional software rather than excessive documentation."},{question:"What does the third Agile Manifesto value emphasize?",options:["Documentation","Customer collaboration over contract negotiation","Testing","Planning"],correct:1,explanation:"The third value is 'Customer collaboration over contract negotiation.' This emphasizes ongoing collaboration with customers rather than just following a contract."},{question:"What is the fourth Agile Manifesto value?",options:["Following a plan","Responding to change over following a plan","Comprehensive documentation","Fixed requirements"],correct:1,explanation:"The fourth value is 'Responding to change over following a plan.'

Scrum is based on empiricism."},{question:"What are the three pillars of empiricism in Scrum?",options:["Plan, Do, Check","Transparency, Inspection, Adaptation","People, Process, Technology","Quality, Speed, Cost"],correct:1,explanation:"The three pillars supporting empirical process control in Scrum are Transparency (visibility of significant aspects), Inspection (frequent checks), and Adaptation (adjustments when needed)."},{question:"What is a hybrid approach in project management?",options:["Using multiple tools","Combining predictive and adaptive approaches","Mixed team structure","Blended budget"],correct:1,explanation:"A hybrid approach combines elements of predictive (plan-driven) and adaptive (Agile) approaches, tailored to the specific needs and constraints of the project."},{question:"When should you use a hybrid approach?",options:["Always","When parts of the project benefit from different approaches","Never","Only for large projects"],correct:1,explanation:"Use a hybrid approach when different parts of the project benefit from different approaches, or when organizational constraints require some traditional practices alongside Agile."},{question:"What is iteration in Agile?",options:["Repeating the same work","A time-boxed period for development","Going in circles","Rework"],correct:1,explanation:"An iteration is a time-boxed period during which development work is completed. The term is often used interchangeably with Sprint in Scrum."},{question:"What is the Agile principle regarding sustainable development?",options:["Use renewable energy","Agile processes promote sustainable development with constant pace indefinitely","Protect the environment","Long-term projects only"],correct:1,explanation:"One of the 12 Agile principles states: 'Agile processes promote sustainable development.
