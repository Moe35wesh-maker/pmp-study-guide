                correct: 1,
                explanation: "B is correct. The best approach is to identify quick wins or incremental deliveries that can provide value sooner while maintaining the full project scope.

This approach maintains strategic coherence while addressing diverse stakeholder needs and provides a framework for measuring value across the organization."

                explanation: "B is correct. Compliance requirements should be integrated into current project planning to ensure the project outcome meets regulatory standards when delivered. Proactive compliance integration prevents rework and ensures the project delivers value that meets all regulatory requirements."
